<i><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classical name Petra, and the early name Sela both mean the same thing,
" Rock "; and surely no city was ever more aptly named. But " Rock " 
only conveys half the picture of the city: the wild, fantastic shapes of the hills,
the great chasms which cleave them, the brilliant colouring--all these must be seen 
to be be]ieved. Petra is unique alike in its antiquities, its natural setting,
and its approach.
The track winds down the hill from the little village of Wady Musa, with its neatly 
terraced gardens and vineyards looking more like a model than reality, and the first 
glimpse of the wildness. the first impression of the strangeness of the place is felt
on entering the valley at the foot. Rocks weathered by tims into rounded masses like domed towers, the facade of an occasional tomb showing unexpectedly in some side valley--all is so different from what has just been left behind that there is the sensation of having
wandered into another world. The valley narrows, and a sheer cliff in front seems to 
offer little promise of further progress. Rounding a corner, a great dam built of carefully dressed blocks of stone fills the valley from side to side and confirms this impression, 
but there is a narrow cleft in the cliff- face just by the wall.<br> This is the road to Petra, and a handful of men could hold it against an army.
